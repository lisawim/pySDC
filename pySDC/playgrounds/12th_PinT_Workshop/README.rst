pySDC Tutorial at 12th PinT Workshop
====================================
**Time**: July 19, 2023

**Place**: TU Hamburg-Harburg

Installation
------------
In order to start playing, install `pySDC` and it's dependencies, ideally in developer mode.
First start by setting up a virtual environment, e.g. by using `Micromamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html>`_,
assuming you are in this directory here:

.. code-block:: bash

    micromamba env create -f environment-tutorial.yml
    micromamba activate pySDC_tutorial

When this is done (and it can take a while), download `pySDC` from GitHub.
There are multiple ways to do that, but if you plan to work with pySDC directly, the best way is to
(1) `fork <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks>`_
the main repository to your Github account and then
(2) `clone <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository>`_ it from there.
This way you can work on a separate repository while being able to pull updates from the main one and
starting pull requests to merge back your ideas.
You can also clone the main repository, but this will not accept your pushes.
Downloading `pySDC` as a tarball is the easiest, but also the least favorable solution.
Finally, the code can also be obtained using ``pip install``, but then sources are not that easily accessible.

So, please go ahead and clone from Github:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/<your_account>/pySDC.git

Note that this folder and all changes in it will remain even if you leave the virtual environment.
Only installations made with ``micromamba`` or ``pip`` are affected by changing the environment.
Use `branches <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches>`_
to isolate development work.

Testing
-------

Change to `pySDC`'s root directory and run

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest pySDC/tests -m mpi4py

This will check if "all" went well with the installation you just created.
If it does, you are now ready to play with `pySDC`.

Jupyter
-------
In order to work with the Jupyter notebooks, we need one more magical package, this time via ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install jdc

These `Jupyter Dynamic Classes <https://alexhagen.github.io/jdc/>`_ allows us to define a class spanning multiple cells to keep things short and to have sufficient documentation.
Continue with one of the playgrounds in this directory then. You may have to augment the ``PYTHONPATH`` to find the root directory of `pySDC` before things run from the ``playgrounds`` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<path_to_pySDC>

Then, if you want to run stuff in parallel (but locally), start an ``ipcluster`` with

.. code-block:: bash

    ipcluster start --engines=MPI -n 4

Fire up a new shell, remember to augment the `PYTHONPATH` as before and start a jupyter notebook via

.. code-block:: bash

    jupyter notebook
