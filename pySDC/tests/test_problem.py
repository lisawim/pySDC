    Test the generation of reference solutions with scipy.
    A Dahlquist problem is solved using scipy and exactly. Depending on the shape that is passed in `init`, this can
    emulate a PDE. What is really tested in terms of PDEs is that the changes in shape of the solution object is handled
    correctly.

        init (list): Object similar to the `init` that you use for the problem class
